# Thinkful Capstone Project- Project  Flashcard-o-matic

The goal of this project was to create an application that allows users to create flash card decks for studying. Users can either create their own deck our review decks that already exist in the database. 

This application utilizes React, Switch, Route, and effect hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useParams, and useHistory. The CSS framework Bootstrap was also used to add some styling to the application.
